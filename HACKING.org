Palette layout:
0-7: fixed? colors
8-15: two four-color groups of variations, from dark to light,
luminance 30, 62, 94, and 126, respectively.

| 0 | transparent |
| 1 | 8 8 8       |
| 2 | 88 88 88    |
| 3 | 168 168 168 |
| 4 | 252 252 248 |
| 5 | 124 120 60  |
| 6 | 176 172 104 |
| 7 | 228 224 152 |

Balloonist frames are 16x16; balloons and tiles are 8x8.

The tilemap ~hbs.map~ was probably produced with ~timhe~, but it's not
exactly clear what the layout is (looks like 32x32 with 8x8 tiles, but
there are still some other bytes whose purpose I don't recall).  It
will probably be faster to import ~mortimer~ from Convergence and use
it to produce a background from the existing tiles.
