* Hyper Ballon Struggle

[[what.png]]

This is my first [[http://onegameamonth.com/][#1GAM]] game: Hyper Ballon Struggle for the Gameboy
Advance.  This is actually a game that was written the weekend of July
26-28, 2002 during a party of some sort.  Unfortunately later copies
of the source are so far unavailable, so I've decided to work from
this copy which seems to be a CVS checkout from early on Sunday.

** Building

On a Debian system, you can do this to get a suitable cross-compiler
installed:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dpkg --add-architecture armel
apt-get update
apt-get install gcc-4.9-arm-gnueabi
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then build with ~make~.  Any GBA emulator should be able to play the
resulting bin file.
